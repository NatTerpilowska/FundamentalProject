# **Introduction**


Objective
My overall objective with this project is the following:

"To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training." - QA Community

Proposal:

For this project I have decided to develop an app that generates D&D story prompts based on; tarot cards, their symbols and meaning and inspiration from illustrations where the user is able to generate a random card and story and add their own personal ideas.

My planned CRUD is as follows:

Read/view

Generate new

Add

Refresh
